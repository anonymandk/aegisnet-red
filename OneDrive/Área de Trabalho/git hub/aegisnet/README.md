# AegisNet-Red

Adversarial framework for studying and exploiting  
security weaknesses in encrypted P2P communication systems.

## Purpose

This project was created to simulate real-world attack scenarios  
against modern secure messaging protocols.

## Focus Areas

- MITM
- Replay attacks
- Super-node abuse
- Protocol downgrade
- Traffic analysis

## Disclaimer

This project is for educational and research purposes only.

## Security Research Scope

This framework simulates adversarial behaviors such as replay attacks
and MITM key substitution for defensive analysis only.

## Adversarial Scenarios

- Replay attack simulation with time window detection
- MITM key substitution and downgrade detection
- Super-node abuse and availability attacks
- Traffic analysis via metadata inference
